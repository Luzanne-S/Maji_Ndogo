<h1>Water Crisis</h1>
Access to water is a human right and in a fictional country* accessing water for the majority of citizens is less accessible than international standards.

The data collected on water sources, water collection, and crime within the country provide us with a deeper
understanding of the daily life of its inhabitants and the critical role water plays in their lives.

<h3>Project 1</h3>
--Understanding the 60 000 records collected by surveyors and engineers <br/>
--Identify the different water sources <br/>
--Discover the visiting patterns from surveyors <br/>
--Document pollution issues in the water sources

<h3>Project 2</h3>
--Cleaning up additional data  <br/>
--Breaking down the scope of the problem<br/>
--Creating hypothesis<br/>
--Analyse water collection queues

<h3>Project 3</h3>
--Creating an ERD to understand the relationship of the tables<br/>
--Joining tables to find duplicates in the data <br/>
--Linking tables to find discrepancies: numerous visits to locations, reports of potential fraud<br/>

<h3>Project 4</h3>
--Eliminating fraudulent cases<br/>
--Finding a practical solution to implement<br/>
--Creating a table for engineers to update when work has been done on a particular project<br/>


<h5>Once querying was complete the dataset was transferred to Power BI for visualisation</h5>
